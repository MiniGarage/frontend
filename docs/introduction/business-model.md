## 💰 Revenue Streams

### 1. **Gacha Box Sales** (Primary Revenue)

Users purchase IDRX tokens to open gacha boxes:

| Box Type | Price (IDRX) | Contents | Expected Revenue |
|----------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Basic Box** | 25,000 | 1 fragment or common car | Entry-level |
| **Premium Box** | 100,000 | Higher rarity chances | High volume |
| **Legendary Box** | 500,000 | Guaranteed rare+ car | Premium users |

**Revenue Model:**
- Users buy IDRX tokens (fiat → IDRX conversion)
- Platform takes **10-15% markup** on IDRX purchases
- Average transaction: **50,000 IDRX** (~$5-10 USD equivalent)

**Example:**
```
User purchases 100,000 IDRX:
- Fiat value: $10 USD
- Platform fee (15%): $1.50 USD
- Net to platform: $1.50 per transaction
- Volume goal: 10,000 transactions/month = $15,000/month
```

### 2. **Marketplace Transaction Fees** (Secondary Revenue)

While the P2P marketplace advertises "zero fees" to users (major selling point), the platform can monetize through:

- **IDRX Faucet Control**: Users need IDRX to trade, driving demand for IDRX purchases
- **Premium Listing Features** (future): Featured listings, promoted cars ($0.50-$2 per listing)
- **Escrow Services** (optional): Trusted trades with platform guarantee (2-5% fee)

**Current Strategy:**
- Free P2P trading to build network effects and volume
- Monetize through IDRX demand (users buy IDRX to participate)

### 3. **Physical Redemption Fees**

Users can burn NFTs to claim physical diecast cars:

| Service | Fee Model | Revenue |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Domestic Shipping (Indonesia)** | $5-8 per car | Covers logistics + margin |
| **International Shipping** | $15-25 per car | Premium pricing |
| **Handling Fee** | Included in shipping | $2-3 margin per order |

**Revenue Potential:**
- 5% redemption rate (500 redemptions from 10,000 NFTs sold)
- Average shipping profit: $5/car
- Monthly revenue: **$2,500** (500 redemptions × $5)

### 4. **IDRX Token Appreciation** (Future)

As ecosystem grows, IDRX utility increases:
- Required for all transactions (gacha, trading, redemption)
- Limited supply with burning mechanics
- Platform holds IDRX treasury for operations
- Token value appreciation benefits platform holdings

### 5. **Future Revenue Streams** (Phase 2+)

- 🎨 **Custom Car NFTs**: Branded collaborations (Ferrari, Lamborghini licensing)
- 🏆 **Premium Memberships**: VIP access, early drops, exclusive cars ($10-20/month)
- 📦 **Mystery Box Events**: Limited-edition seasonal drops (holiday specials)
- 🎮 **Play-to-Earn Mechanics**: Racing mini-games, tournaments with entry fees
- 🤝 **B2B Partnerships**: White-label gacha platform for other collectibles

## 📊 Economic Model (Tokenomics)

### IDRX Token Design

**Token Purpose:**
- In-game currency for all transactions
- Culturally familiar denominations (mimics Indonesian Rupiah)
- Gasless UX (users never see gas fees)

**Supply Mechanics:**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 10,000,000,000 IDRX | 10 Billion tokens |
| **Initial Distribution** | 30% (3B) | Public faucet/airdrops |
| **Platform Treasury** | 40% (4B) | Operations, rewards, liquidity |
| **Team/Advisors** | 10% (1B) | 2-year vesting |
| **Ecosystem Growth** | 20% (2B) | Partnerships, marketing |

**Token Utility:**
1. **Gacha Purchases**: 25K-500K IDRX per box
2. **Marketplace Trading**: IDRX-denominated pricing
3. **Physical Redemption**: IDRX fee for shipping/handling
4. **Daily Rewards**: Check-in bonuses in IDRX
5. **Governance** (future): Vote on new car series

### Deflationary Mechanics

**Why Deflationary?**
- Creates scarcity over time
- Aligns user incentives with platform growth
- Increases value for long-term holders

**Burning Mechanisms:**

1. **NFT Redemption Burning** 🔥
   - User burns NFT to claim physical car
   - Reduces NFT supply permanently
   - Example: 1,000 legendary NFTs minted → 200 redeemed → only 800 remain

2. **IDRX Transaction Burns** (future) 🔥
   - Small % of each transaction burned (1-3%)
   - Reduces IDRX supply over time
   - Example: 10M IDRX traded/month → 200K IDRX burned

3. **Supply Cap Enforcement** 🔒
   - Hard-coded NFT supply caps (e.g., only 10 Legendary Ferrari)
   - No infinite minting = provable scarcity
   - Tied to physical inventory

**Example Economic Flow:**

```
Month 1:
- 1,000 NFTs minted
- 50 redeemed for physical (5% burn rate)
- Remaining supply: 950 NFTs
- Scarcity increases → Prices rise

Month 6:
- 5,000 NFTs minted total
- 500 redeemed (10% cumulative burn)
- Remaining supply: 4,500 NFTs
- Marketplace value +30%
```
