# Security & Audits

MiniGarage prioritizes user safety, asset ownership, and secure gasless infrastructure.

## 🏛️ Smart Contract Security

Our contracts are built upon battle-tested standards to ensure robust security.

### 1. Standardized Implementations

We use **OpenZeppelin** contracts for all core standards, minimizing the risk of custom implementation errors.

* **ERC-721**: For Car NFTs (`BaseWheelsCars.sol`)
* **ERC-1155**: For Fragments (`BaseWheelsFragments.sol`)
* **ERC-20**: For In-Game Currency (`MockIDRXv2.sol`)
* **Ownable**: For strict access control

### 2. Access Control

We employ a clear separation of privileges:

* **Contract Chain Owner:** Has administrative rights (e.g., upgrading contracts, setting base URIs).
* **Minter Role (Backend Relayer):** Authorized _only_ to mint rewards when a gacha or crafting action is verified.
* **User:** Has full control over their own assets (transfers, approvals). **We cannot confiscate your NFTs.**

### 3. Protection Mechanisms

* **Reentrancy Guards:** Applied to critical functions where external calls are made.
* **SafeMint:** Used to prevent tokens from being locked in contracts that cannot handle them.

## 🔒 Backend & Relayer Security

Since we pay for your gas, securing our backend is critical.

### 1. Gas Sponsorship Safety

To prevent "gas draining" attacks where malicious users spam transactions to deplete our treasury:

* **Rate Limiting:** Users are limited to a specific number of actions per minute.
* **Signature Verification:** The backend only relays transactions signed by authenticated users.
* **Context Validation:** A "Craft" transaction is only relayed if the user actually holds the required 5 fragments in the database verification step _before_ hitting the chain.

### 2. Private Key Management

* **Relayer Keys:** Stored in secure, encrypted environment variables (not in code).
* **Non-Custodial Users:** We do NOT store your wallet's private keys. Privy manages the embedded wallet infrastructure securely.

## 🕵️ Audit Status

### Current Status: Internal Review

As a Hackathon MVP, the contracts have undergone:

1. **Automated Analysis:** Slither & Mythril scans for common vulnerabilities.
2. **Internal Peer Review:** Line-by-line manual code review by the development team.
3. **Testnet Stress Testing:** Validated with 500+ mock users and thousands of transactions.

### Future Roadmap: Professional Audit

Before mainnet launch, we are committed to:

* **Third-Party Audit:** Engaging a firm like CertiK or similar to audit our `Gacha` and `Marketplace` logic.
* **Bug Bounty:** Launching a program to reward community white-hat hackers.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is currently a testnet demonstration. Do not use real funds.
