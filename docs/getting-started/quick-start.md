## Step 4: Open Your First Gacha

Navigate to the **Gacha** section inside MiniGarage.

### How Gacha Works (Simplified)

- Each roll consumes a fixed amount of IDRX
- You will receive **either**:
  - A complete car NFT  
  - Or a fragment NFT  

All rewards are minted **on-chain** and sent directly to your wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some testnet approval transactions may require a **small amount of Base Sepolia ETH**.  
This is only for testnet interaction.
{% endhint %}

### Possible Outcomes

**Complete Car NFT**
- Immediately usable
- Tradeable on the marketplace
- Stored permanently in your wallet

**Fragment NFT**
- Collect fragments over time
- Combine fragments to craft a full car
- Fragments are also tradeable
